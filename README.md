# Music player on Server

As part of learning to code,I completed a project that involved creating a basic Music player on server using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was designed to showcase my skills in front-end web development.It is a responsive and user-friendly web application that allows users to play music.I used HTML and CSS to design and style the interface, and I implemented JavaScript to handle user input and interaction such as basic playback controls -play, pause, and next.I also gained experience working with version control tools such as Git and GitHub.
